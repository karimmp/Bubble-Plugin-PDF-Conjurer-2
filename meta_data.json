    "description": "A free, powerful, reliable and flexible plugin that allows you to create PDF files to be downloaded, opened or printed by your user's browser and/or save the PDF to your database. \n\nIt works in the browser page and in backend workflows, uses no API, no external services and does not increase your app's costs. \nIf used in the backend workflow it uses a little app capacity just like any other backend workflow.\n\nSee forum thread for instructions:\nhttps://forum.bubble.is/t/new-plugin-pdf-conjurer/43240\nUse the search tool to find specific information in that topic.\n\nAlso, you can find some consolidated instructions here, but mind you, this doc page is still in alpha stage:\nhttps://sdfsfsdfsdf.bubbleapps.io/\n",
